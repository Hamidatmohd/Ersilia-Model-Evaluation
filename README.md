# Ersilia-Model-Evaluation - Outreachy 2024 
## May cohort contribution phase
The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning for Fast Aqueous Solubility Prediction 

# eos6oli
This is the model selected from the Erisilia model Hub which is used in completeing the model bias task. This is to test the model"s predictions for bias.

# SolTraNnet Model
This is the model used by the author and it is the selected model used to complete the model reproducibility task. This is to show if the model prediction can be reproduced using the same AqSol Dataset.

# Repository Organization
The repository is organized as follows:
* '/data' contains the reference_libraby dataset used for the model bias and aqsol dataset used for model reproducibility.
* '/notebooks' contains the jupyter notebooks that houses all the code used.
* '/src' contains important functions used to aviod repetition.
* '/figures' contains the plot produced during the model validation from the model bias task.
* 'requirement.txt' lists all the required packages and libraries needed to run the notebooks.
